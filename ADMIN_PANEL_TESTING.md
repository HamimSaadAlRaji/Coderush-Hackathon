### Test Cases to Verify

#### 1. **Admin Panel Access** ‚úÖ

  - Status badge

#### 3. **Status Breakdown Dashboard**

  - Approved: 0 listings (initially)
  - Rejected: 0 listings (initially)

#### 4. **Filtering Functionality**
- [ ] Test "All Statuses" filter (should show all listings)
- [ ] Test "Pending" filter (should show 5 listings)
- [ ] Test "Approved" filter (should show 0 listings initially)
- [ ] Test "Rejected" filter (should show 0 listings initially)

#### 5. **Approval Workflow**
- [ ] Click "Approve" on a listing
- [ ] Verify the listing status changes to "APPROVED"

- [ ] Check that filtering still works after page refresh

#### 9. **Error Handling**

- [ ] Verify appropriate error messages are displayed

#### 10. **Integration with Public Listings**

- [ ] Verify only approved listings are visible to regular users
- [ ] Pending and rejected listings should not appear

### Expected Behavior

1. **Pending Listings**: Show approve/reject buttons
2. **Approved Listings**: Show green "‚úì Approved" indicator
3. **Rejected Listings**: Show red "‚úó Rejected" indicator + rejection reason
4. **Status Filters**: Properly filter listings by approval status
5. **Real-time Updates**: Status changes reflect immediately in the UI

### Testing the Complete Workflow

1. **Start with 5 pending listings**
2. **Approve 2 listings** ‚Üí Status breakdown should show: Pending(3), Approved(2), Rejected(0)
3. **Reject 1 listing with reason** ‚Üí Status breakdown should show: Pending(2), Approved(2), Rejected(1)
4. **Filter by "Approved"** ‚Üí Should show only the 2 approved listings
5. **Check public listings page** ‚Üí Should only show the 2 approved listings

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

If you encounter issues:

1. **Can't access admin panel**: Check your user role in the database
2. **No listings showing**: Run the test listing script again
3. **Approval/rejection not working**: Check browser console for errors
4. **Status not updating**: Check network tab for API call responses

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- ‚úÖ Admin users can access the panel
- ‚úÖ All pending listings are displayed with proper information

3. Add audit logging for admin actions
4. Consider adding appeal process for rejected listings
