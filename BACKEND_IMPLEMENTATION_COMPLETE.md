# Marketplace Backend Implementation - COMPLETED

## 🎉 Implementation Status: **COMPLETE**

The complete backend feature for image upload and listing creation has been successfully implemented for the Next.js marketplace application.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Models** (MongoDB with Mongoose)
- **User Model** (`models/User.ts`) - Complete Mongoose schema with Clerk integration
- **Listing Model** (`models/Listing.ts`) - Complete schema with validation, indexes, and proper typing

### 2. **Image Upload System**
- **Cloudinary Integration** (`lib/cloudinary.ts`) - Upload, delete, and optimization functions
- **Upload API** (`app/api/upload-image/route.ts`) - Simplified image upload without AI analysis
- **React Hook** (`lib/hooks/useImageUpload.ts`) - Frontend hook for image upload with progress tracking
- **Upload Component** (`components/ImageUpload.tsx`) - Drag-and-drop interface with preview and retry functionality

### 3. **Listing Management APIs**
- **Main Listings API** (`app/api/listings/route.ts`)
  - `POST` - Create new listings with authentication and auto-user creation
  - `GET` - Fetch listings with pagination, filtering, and search
- **Individual Listing API** (`app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts`)
  - `GET` - Fetch single listing by ID
  - `PATCH` - Update listing (owner-only)
  - `DELETE` - Soft delete listing (owner-only)

### 4. **User Management**
- **User API** (`app/api/users/route.ts`)
  - `POST` - Create/sync user from Clerk
  - `GET` - Fetch user profile
  - `PATCH` - Update user profile
- **Auto-sync with Clerk** - Users are automatically created when they create listings

### 5. **Frontend Integration**
- **Create Listings Page** (`app/(root)/create-listings/page.tsx`)
  - Multi-step form with image upload integration
  - Real API submission with error handling
  - Form validation and user feedback
- **My Listings Page** (`app/(root)/my-listings/page.tsx`)
  - Displays user's listings from database
  - Edit and delete functionality
  - Loading states and error handling

### 6. **Testing & Utilities**
- **Database Test API** (`app/api/test-db/route.ts`) - Verify database connection
- **Health Check** (`app/api/health/route.ts`) - Application health monitoring
